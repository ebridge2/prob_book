    "Next, we'll get to some convergence concepts that will be useful throughout this course. These will often be conducted on series, which are basically sequential sums of sequences:\n",

    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$ be a set, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. A $m$-element partial sum of the sequence is:\n",

    "    s_m = \\sum_{n = 1}^m a_n\n",

    "````{prf:definition} Series\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$ be a set, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. A series on $\\mathcal A$ is the inifinte sum:\n",

    "If the limit exists and is finite, we say that the series converges; otherwise, we say that the series diverges.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're going to be extremely interested in the behavior of these series and their behaviors. This means that we need some tools to easily let us determine for which particular sequences $(a_n)$ that the resulting series converges/diverges. First up is the simplest test, the comparison test:\n",

    "1. If $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty b_n$ is a convergent series and $a_n \\leq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty$ converges.\n",
