    "# Convergence Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll get to some convergence concepts that will be useful throughout this course. These will often be conducted on series, which are basically sequential sums of sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:definition} Partial sum\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$ be a set, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. A $m$-element partial sum of the sequence is:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    s_m = \\sum_{n = 1}^m a_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to define a series:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:definition} Series\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$ be a set, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. A series on $\\mathcal A$ is the inifinte sum:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n\n",
    "```\n",
    "With $s_m = \\sum_{n = 1}^m a_n$ the $m^{th}$ partial sum, we define the sum of the series to be:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{m \\rightarrow \\infty} s_m\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the limit exists and is finite, we say that the series converges; otherwise, we say that the series diverges.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convergence tests\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be extremely interested in the behavior of these series and their behaviors. This means that we need some tools to easily let us determine for which particular sequences $(a_n)$ that the resulting series converges/diverges. These tend to be called convergence tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison test\n",
    "\n",
    "First up is the simplest test, the comparison test:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} Comparison Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:comp\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$, and let $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ be sequences on $\\mathcal A$ where all $a_n, b_n \\geq 0$. Then:\n",
    "1. If $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty b_n$ is a convergent series and $a_n \\leq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty$ converges.\n",
    "2. If $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty b_n$ is a divergent series and $a_n \\geq b_n$ for all $n$, then $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n$ diverges.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have easy-to-use series that we already know behavior about, this can make proving convergence somewhat trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Integral test\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is the integral test:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} Integral Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:integral\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. Let $f : \\mathbb R \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ be a function, where in particular $f(n) = a_n$. If $f$ is positive, continuous, and decreasing, then both:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n \\text{ and }\\int_1^\\infty f(n)\\text{d} n\n",
    "```\n",
    "converge or diverge.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, when faced with a seemingly daunting example, it might make sense to just string together multiple tests to prove your desired result. Let's look at quick example of the integral test and the comparison test being used together in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:example}\n",
    ":label: ex:foundations:conv_tests:integral\n",
    "Let's consider the series:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n(\\log n)^s}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If $s = 1$, let's take a look at that integral. Notice that:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\int_2^\\infty \\frac{1}{n(\\log n)}\\text{d} n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we choose $u = \\log n$, we obtain that $\\frac{\\text{d}u}{\\text{d}n} = \\frac{1}{n}$, so $\\text{d}u = \\frac{1}{n}\\text{d}n$. Then our integral is:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\int_{\\log 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{u}\\text{d} u &= \\log(u) + C\\big |_{u=\\log 2}^\\infty \\\\\n",
    "&=  \\log(\\log n) + C\\big |_{n=2}^\\infty = \\infty\n",
    "```\n",
    "so the series diverges.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $s < 1$, then $\\frac{1}{n (\\log n)^s} > \\frac{1}{n (\\log n)} \\geq 0$, so this series must diverge by {prf:ref}`lem:foundations:conv_tests:comp`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When $s > 1$, then we can't just use the comparison test, so we need to calculate this integral out as well. This is because the terms of the sequence $\\frac{1}{n \\log^s n}$ are not bigger than $\\frac{1}{n\\log n}$. Using the same $u$-substitution as before, we get:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\\int_2^\\infty \\frac{1}{n(\\log n)^s}\\text{d} n &= \n",
    "\\int_2^\\infty u^{-s}\\text{d} u \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{u^{1 - s}}{1 - s} + C \\big|_{u = \\log 2}^\\infty \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{(\\log n)^{1 - s}}{1 - s} \\big|_{ n = 2}^\\infty \\\\\n",
    "&= -\\frac{1}{(s - 1)(\\log n)^{s - 1}} \\big|_{n = 2}^\\infty \\\\\n",
    "&= 0 + \\frac{1}{(s - 1)\\log(2)^{s - 1}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which is finite (the integral is convergent). So our results are:\n",
    "1. If $s \\leq 1$, the series diverges.\n",
    "2. If $s > 1$, the series converges.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### $p$-series test\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is probably the most important convergence result that you will want to know inside and out, the $p$-series convergence test:\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} $p$-series Convergence Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:pseries\n",
    "The $p$-series is given by, with $p > 0$:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "    \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^p}\n",
    "```\n",
    "If $p > 1$, then the series converges. If $p \\in (0, 1]$, then the series diverges.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratio Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The next test is one of the more easily used convergence tests, as it amounts to taking the limit of two numbers. It is called the ratio test, and is based on the ratios of consecutive terms; e.g., $r_n \\triangleq \\frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}$. The statement is rather big and involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} Ratio Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:ratio\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. Consider the series $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n$, where $a_n \\neq 0$ for large $n$. Let $L = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}|r_n|$, where $r_n = \\frac{a_{n + 1}}{a_n}$. If $L$ exists, then:\n",
    "1. If $L < 1$, the series converges absolutely.\n",
    "2. If $L = 1$, the test is inconclusive.\n",
    "3. If $L > 1$, the series diverges.\n",
    "Further, if $L$ does not exist, let $S = \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} |r_n|$ and $I = \\liminf_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}|r_n|$. Then:\n",
    "1. If $S > 1$, the series converges absolutely.\n",
    "2. If $R < 1$, the series diverges.\n",
    "3. If $|r_n| \\geq 1$ for all large $n$, regardless of the value of $R$, the series diverges.\n",
    "4. Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the nice aspect of this test is, we only need to think about the behavior of $r_n$ in the tail. This means we can couple the ratio test with other nice results that operate on ratios of two numbers, like L'H\\^opital's rule, for determining behavior about the series. The downside is that these inconclusive cases can sometimes be rather annoying. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The next test can also be useful if we have terms that can easily be upper bounded by an $n^{th}$ root, such as polynomial expressions. This is called the root test:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} Root Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:root\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$, and let $(a_n)$ be a sequence on $\\mathcal A$. Consider the series $\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n$, and let $C = \\limsup_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}$. If:\n",
    "1. $C < 1$, the series converges absolutely.\n",
    "2. If $C > 1$, the series diverges.\n",
    "3. If $C = 1$, and further, $\\sqrt[n]{|a_n|} \\downarrow 1$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the series diverges.\n",
    "4. Otherwise, the test is inconclusive.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limit Comparison Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The next test looks only at the limits of a pair of sequence to determine behaviors, and is pretty similar to the comparison test.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:lemma} Limit Comparison Test\n",
    ":label: lem:foundations:conv_tests:lim_cmp\n",
    "Let $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathbb R$, and let $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ be two sequences on $\\mathcal A$. Further, assume that $a_n \\geq 0$, and $b_n > 0$, for all $n \\in \\mathbb N$. Then:\n",
    "1. If $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\frac{a_n}{b_n} > 0$ is finite, then $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} a_n$ converges $\\iff \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} b_n$ converges.\n",
    "2. If $\\lim_{n \\rightarorow \\infty}\\frac{a_n}{b_n} = 0$ and $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} b_n$ converges, then $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} b_n$ converges.\n",
    "3. If $\\lim_{n \\rightarorow \\infty}\\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \\infty$ and $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} b_n$ diverges, then $\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb N} a_n$ diverges.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how to use this one with an example, where we chain together the comparison test with the limit comparison test and the $p$-series convergence test:\n",
