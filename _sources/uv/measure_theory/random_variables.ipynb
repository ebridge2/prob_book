    "Next up is one of the most misunderstood (and most unnecessarily terrifying) concepts of traditional probability and statistics courses: the random variable. Let's start with a definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:definition} $(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$-Random Variable\n",
    ":label: uv:mt:rvs:rv\n",
    "Suppose that $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F)$ and $(S, \\Sigma)$ are two measurable spaces. A function $X : \\Omega \\rightarrow S$ is said to be a measurable map from $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F)$ to $(S, \\Sigma)$ if for all $B \\in \\Sigma$:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "X^{-1}(B) \\equiv \\{X \\in B\\} \\equiv \\{\\omega : X(\\omega) \\in B\\} \\in \\mathcal F\n",
    "```\n",
    "Written another way:\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "X^{-1}(\\Sigma) \\equiv \\{X^{-1}(B) : B \\in \\Sigma\\} \\equiv \\left\\{\\{\\omega : X(\\omega) \\in B\\} : B \\in \\Sigma\\right\\}\\subseteq \\mathcal F\n",
    "```\n",
    "For such a measurable map $X$, $X$ is said to be a $(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$-valued random variable, or it is $(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$-measurable. In shorthand, we denote that $X \\in m(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$.\n",
    "````\n",
    "That definition was quite large, and the interpretation of this definition is really at the heart of the difference between traditional probability and statistics with measure theoretic probability and statistics. Let's break down all of the things that this definition is saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first aspect to fixate on here is that for some $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, $X$ maps $\\omega$ to some other point $s \\in \\mathcal S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "All that the first line says is that, when we take some subset of the codomain $S$ that is in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\Sigma$, $B \\in \\Sigma$, that the set of all $\\omega$ where $X(\\omega) \\in B$ is in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal F$ (this is made extremely clear by the right-most set). Stated mathematically, for any $B \\in \\Sigma$, the *preimage* of $B$ is in $\\mathcal F$. The left two notations, $X^{-1}(B)$ and $\\{X \\in B\\}$, are simply shorthands for the statement at the right. Random variables can, and will, become extremely confusing simply by way of people seeing the shorthands, and then forgetting what the shorthand actually means. The $\\equiv$ symbol is just used to make explicit that the notations are not just equal, they say exactly the same thing. The idea is that the preimage of elements of the $\\sigma$-algebra of $S$ are in the $\\sigma$-algebra of $\\Omega$. In a figure, this looks kind of like this:\n",

    "Here, the blue circle represents the event space $\\Omega$, and the target space $S$ is represented by the red square. For some $B \\in \\Sigma$, represented by the dark red circles, there are a set of $\\omega$s which are a subset of $\\Omega$ that map to $B$ under $X$. The collection of all such $\\omega$s, here shown in dark blue circles, comprise a set which is in $\\mathcal F$, the $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line simply states this another way. This notation can get confusing, and while I'm going to take the time to write out the equivalences every time the first few times you see these sets arise, I'm not always going to write it out every time. Take a long hard look at the previous definition, the equivalent notations, and learn to love them!\n",

    "````{prf:remark} Shorthand when codomain is a subset of the reals\n",
    "Suppose that $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F)$ and $(S, \\Sigma)$ are two measurable spaces, and $X \\in m(\\mathcal F, \\mathcal \\Sigma)$. If $S \\subseteq \\mathbb R$ and $\\Sigma = \\mathcal B(S)$, then we will use the shorthand $X \\in m\\mathcal F$.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the codomain are going to be real values, and the $\\sigma$-algebra is just going to be the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra, so it gets cumbersome to always have to write all of this out, so we adopt the above shorthand fairly often as the book proceeds. \n",

    "You'll often see us go back and forth throughout this book using the words measurable and random variable. Probability theorists tend to like the word random variable, and mathematicians tend to like the word measurable. We will tend to stick to the probability theory language later on, but it is important to cement in your head that there is nothing \"random\" about these things really; random variables (measurable functions), follow a prescribed set of rules, and really thinking hard about these rules will make them feel a little less mysterious.\n",

However, we can describe generators of $\\mathcal R$, and then we can use {prf:ref}`uv:mt:rvs:generator_set` to evaluate whether a function is measurable (a random variable).\n",
