    "So, let's reflect back briefly to the journey we've taken so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The path we've taken\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basics of measure theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We started way back in {numref}`mt:intro:set_theory` by introducing some basics about sets and families of sets. We learned that we could have families of sets (sets of subsets) where we could equip the sets with a notion of measure, that for all intents and purposes, felt like it satisfied the intuitive concept of \"size\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon these so-called measure spaces, we could construct functions, called random variables, in which there was a notion of one-to-oneness of the inverse mapping with sets of the respective $\\sigma$-algebras (*measurable* functions). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we confined ourselves to probability spaces, we could qualify that these pushforward measures were qualified as a *law* of a random variable, which was a probability measure induced on the codomain. The law of the random variable could further be uniquely determined by the distribution function of the random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The basics of integration \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we built out all of the machinery that we needed to devise integrals on measure spaces in which the codomain are real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed how we could build up from simple functions, to bounded functions, to non-negative, to integrable functions, with each integral, in effect, being well-defined using a simpler function and the behaviors of sets of simpler functions which in the limit would be our desired function of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw how with the particularity of considering only probability spaces, that these integrals could be further characterized as expectations, and we obtained even more properties about integrals with respect to these particular spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what did we miss?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushforward measures allow us to extend integration beyong real-valued codomains\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that, in the reflection we described above, that there was an important clarification: in all of the integration material we've covered so far, the codomain is *strictly* real numbers. This means that for a given event space $\\Omega$, the *only* random variables $X$ that we know how to integrate with (thus far) are those where $X(\\omega)$ takes real values. \n",
    "\n",
    "How big do you think a brain imaging measurement is? How complicated do you think a genome might be? There are *tons* of types of data that, for modern scientific practices, really *cannot* just be summarized with a real value. This means that as we are building out our machinery, we left out one of the biggest pieces of all: what do we do when we have more than a single real-valued number? How can we proceed?\n",
    "\n",
    "As it so happens, a concept we already discussed, pushforward meaures, tied together with a new concept which we'll get to in a second, are all that we need to integrate on much more complicated spaces. At a high level, what we're going to do is a similar approach to what you saw back when we first defined the [Lebesgue measure](mt:intro:prob_spaces:meas:lebesgue): we're going to define a set of sets which are on $\\mathbb R^d$ (the $d$-dimensional real numbers), we're going to show that this set of sets fulfills properties which put it into a pair of families of sets ($\\pi$-systems and a new family of sets, $\\lambda$-systems, and then we're going to show that we can define a measure using an *extension* from these sets of sets to our space of interest. This is very similar to how we defined the Lebesgue measure using CarothÃ©odory's Extension {prf:ref}`mt:intro:prob_spaces:meas:carotheodory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we'll show how we can build out integration on this new measure space, using Fubini's theorem, to extend what we already learned about integration on the real numbers to the new space. Finally, we'll show how we can use pushforward measures and the change of variables formula to actually compute these integral expressions we came up with over the course of this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some new families of sets\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen $\\pi$-systems, algebras, and $\\sigma$-algebras, and seen how these sets are progressively more restrictive definitions (all $\\sigma$-algebras are algebras, but not all algebras were $\\sigma$-algebras, so on and so forth). If you recall, for a $\\pi$-system, for instance, you learned that it was a non-empty collection closed under finite intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\sigma$-algebra, on the other hand, contained the whole set, was closed under complements, and was closed under countable unions. We learned that $\\pi$-systems were *relaxations* of $\\sigma$-algebras, in that all $\\sigma$-algebras were $\\pi$-systems, but not all $\\pi$-systems were $\\sigma$-algebras. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what was the key that we were missing in $\\pi$-systems make them not quite $\\sigma$-algebras? From the definition, it *looks* like just about everything, but we can be a bit more specific. We can differentiate $\\pi$-systems from $\\sigma$-algebras succinctly: the $\\pi$-systems that are $\\sigma$-algebras are also $\\lambda$-systems, which is a new family of sets:\n",

This looks *really close* to the definition of a $\\sigma$-algebra, but there is a key difference: the $\\lambda$-system is only closed under countable *increasing* unions. This property can be restated another way to look even closer to the definition of a $\\sigma$-algebra:\n",

    "## Change of variables\n",

    "Just because we showed that you *can* calculate all the integrals we have discussed thus far, doesn't mean we *want to*. The reason that we have introduced all this new notation, which might feel cumbersome at first, is that it will ultimately make your understanding of random variables and concepts deriving from all the things we've discussed thus far a *lot* easier to wrap your head around. Plainly, the expressions just happen to be a lot simpler, and the rules easier to follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you actually need to arrive at a numerical solution to an integral, it's typically a lot easier to use the rules of Riemann integration that you've learned through Calculus than it is to use rules like {prf:ref}`mt:int:basics:bounded_int`, {prf:ref}`mt:int:basics:nn:int_def`, or {prf:ref}`mt:int:basics:muint:int`, whenever possible. So, ideally, we will be able to benefit from the conceptual niceties of the measure-theoretic integration intuition that we've developed, but *still* be able to calculate these things numerically in practice.
