    "In many of your mathematics courses to date, you have probably been exposed to integrals (especially, the popular Riemann integral). Here, we're going to build up a more generic definition of an integral; that is, the ability to perform integration on *any* measurable space, rather than just Riemann ones. The way we're going to do this is rather straightforward, and likely matches how your real analysis class built the Riemann integral: we're going to start with the most basic of functions (*simple* functions), and demonstrate that these simple definitions obey desirable and intuitive rules for the integral to have. Then, we're going to gradually relax this extremely simple operation to more and more complicated sorts of functions, until we have general rules for integration that will be sufficient for our treatment of probability theory.\n",

    "Suppose that you have an extremely simple function; e.g., $f(\\omega) = x$, where $x \\in \\mathbb R$ is a constant. This function is certainly simple; e.g., take $\\alpha_n = x$, $F_1 = \\Omega$. It should be pretty clear to you that because it is simple, it is obviously bounded (you can use the number $x$ itself as the bound), it is a rescaling of a non-negative function (if $x < 0$, consider that $f(\\omega) = -g(\\omega)$, where $g(\\omega) = -x \\geq 0$), and it is therefore integrable too, assuming that the measure of the whole space is finite.\n",
