    "In this section, we'll learn about a particular type of integral. Remember that an integral is defined on a measurable space and with respect to a measure; e.g., the measure space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F, \\mu)$. As we learned, when we have simple, bounded, non-negative, or integrable measurable functions $f$, the integral is the operation that is denoted symbolically as $\\int f \\,\\text d \\mu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this measure is *further* a probability measure {prf:ref}`mt:intro:prob_spaces:probmeas:def`, we call this integral something special: we call it an expectation, or expected value. Let's start with a definition.\n",

    "Notationally, you might see this quantity written in several different ways in this book. When we are only talking about a single variable, we'll usually just write $\\mathbb EX$ since it's nice and simple. When the random variable we are taking the expected value of is a bit more complicated, we might add parentheses or square brackets, like this: $\\mathbb E[X]$ or $\\mathbb E(X)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In any previous courses you might have taken on probability or statistics, you might have seen more complicated notations for an expected value (things like subscripts, which get extraordinarily taxing because nearly every statistician/probabilist seems to have a different understanding of what goes in the subscript). For now, we're going to do our best to just omit this cumbersome notation and keep it simple: when you see an expectation of a random variable, you can *always* just think of it as an integral with respect to the corresponding probability space for that random variable. When we learn about product spaces, we'll recap again what it means when we talk about expectations involving multiple random variables.\n",

Intuitionally, the idea here is that, even if one of these are infinite, as long as one of them is finite, we can still make sense of subtracting a finite number from infinity (it is still just infinity) or subtracting infinity from a finite number (it is just negative infinity).\n",

    "Now that we have some of the basics under our belt, I'd recommend you check back to our study of $\\mu$-integrable functions from {prf:ref}`mt:int:basics:muint:intdiff`, and just try to rectify the nuances of that definition to the intuition you are learning here. One thing that you should take away is that, if $X$ is $\\mathbb P$-integrable, then its expected value exists. However, the converse does not necessarily hold: just because an expected value exists does not mean the corresponding random variable is $\\mathbb P$-integrable. The condition for existence of an expectation only requires one of the positive or negative portions being finite, *not* both! \n",

We can also use that the probability of the complement of a set is $1 - $ the probability of the set to deduce that equivalently, $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}\\mathbb P\\left(|X_n - X| > \\epsilon\\right) = 0$.\n",
