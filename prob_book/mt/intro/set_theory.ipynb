    "## What is wrong with traditional probability courses?\n",
    "\n",
    "By reading this book, I'm assuming you've thought about probability at some point in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of probability, one of the first things that might come to your mind is something like a coin flip. The coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$, and tails with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The computations you have inherently made here are that a coin can land on either heads or tails, and both of these outcomes are equally likely, so it makes sense to say that each have a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. When there's a finite number of possible outcomes, this is pretty easy to understand. When we are dealing with random quantities that have only finitely many possible outcomes, we call these quantities *discrete*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say, on the other hand, that I'm throwing a ball. What is the probability that I throw the ball $30$ meters? $40$ meters? $50$ meters? $30.05$ meters? $30.0001$ meters? If we were to assign probabilities of any sort of mass to particular distance totals, we'd quickly run into a problem: there are uncountably many different distances I could possibly throw the ball! Stated another way, maybe it's certain that I would throw the ball between $30$ and $50$ meters (I did play baseball and waterpolo for the better part of a decade), but there are uncountably many points on the real line between $30$ and $50$. Let's say we were to pick to ascribe probabilities every $.0001$ meters, which would result in $\\frac{20}{.0001} = 200000$ possible locations I could throw the ball. If we could assume I'd hit each of these distance totals with equal probability, and say that for any gradation of $.0001$ yards in between $30$ and $50$, I throw the ball that particular distance with probability $\\frac{1}{200000} = 0.000005$. So, the probability of me throwing the ball to the $30.0001$ yards is $0.000005$. But now we've got a new problem: what if I threw the ball $30.00011$ yards? Since I already \"allocated\" all possible distances with my $.0001$ meter gradations, this distance has a probability of $0$ that I throw the ball to it. This is absolutely puzzling and completely counter-intuitive, so I'd need a system that completely breaks with how I ascribe probabilities to the coin flip situation to how I ascribe probabilities with throwing the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that, in this context, the unit that we want to ascribe probabilities to, the distances of the throw, are *continuous*. We could certainly overcome this pretty easily: we could invent a probability system that works when the outcomes are finite (like the coin flips), and we could invent a totally different probability system for when the outcomes are continuous (like throwing the ball). However, this is pretty counter-intuitive: wouldn't it be nice if you could conceptualize any probabilistic system with the same intuition? This is where *measure theory*, and in particular, *probability spaces*, will come into play. Figuring out how to have unified sets of rules, and unified sets of *intuition*, are what makes probability theory so powerful for both theorists and application specialists alike. Probability spaces will serve as the building blocks upon which we can ascribe unified sets of rules for random quantities. \n",
