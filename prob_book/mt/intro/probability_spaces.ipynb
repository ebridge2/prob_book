However, the measure defined on a measurable space ascribes size to countable unions of mutually disjoint subsets of $\\mathcal F$ (which is a $\\sigma$-algebra). Therefore, this countable union of mutually disjoint subsets will *actually end up* being meaningful with respect to the measurable space (since the resulting countable union will also be contained in $\\mathcal F$, since $\\sigma$-algebras are closed under countable unions).\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that these two concepts of a measurable space and a measure are so complementary in this regard (one provides a set and a family of measurable sets, the other prescribes a function for ascribing relational size to the measurable sets), we often group these ideas together with the word *measure space*:\n",
