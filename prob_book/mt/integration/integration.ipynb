    "3. {ref}`mt:int:basics` introduces the concept of integration, one of the most essential operations we will want to use with our random variables through the book.\n",
    "4. {ref}`mt:int:props` introduces the properties of integrals, which will be paramount to our study of random variables later on.\n",
    "3. {ref}`mt:int:exp` introduces the concept of expectation, a special case of integration for a particular codomain and when the measure we are integration with respect to is a probability measure.\n",
    "5. {ref}`mt:int:prod_meas` introduces product measures, which allow us to extend these results to more than one random variable."
