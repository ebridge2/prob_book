We've already seen the class of continuously differentiable functions {prf:ref}`foundations:useful_results:diff_class`, so we are ready to understand the concept behind the Taylor series:\n",

The idea of Taylor's Theorem is that we are, in effect, \"chopping off\" the Taylor series at an arbitrary point, and are left with a remainder that is of a (potentially) extremely low order $o(|x - x_0|^n)$ when $x$ is in a neighborhood of $x_0$.\n",
