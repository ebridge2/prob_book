    "So, now we have these concepts called random variables, which are really just measurable functions on a particular domain with respect to some codomain. We can perform all of the traditional mathematical operations with random variables, and still obtain random variables. What else do we need as far as machinery goes? We need to link these random variables to probabilities. This happens via the distribution function.\n",

    "## Inducing distribution functions\n",

    "Now that we have random variables (measurable functions), if the domain is a probability space, we can use the definition of a random variable to deduce that it is certainly the case that for any set in the codomain, the preimage of the set in the codomain is in the $\\sigma$-algebra of the corresponding probability space. Since this set is in the $\\sigma$-algebra of the probability space, we can assign a probability to that set:\n",

    "Suppose the probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F, \\mathbb P)$ and the measurable space $(S, \\Sigma)$, where $X \\in m(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$ is a random variable. Then the induced probability measure on $S$ by $X$, also known as the *law* of $X$, is the measure $\\mathcal L_X$ where for every $B \\in \\Sigma$:\n",

    "The idea here is that we are, in some sense, finding which values of $\\Omega$ were mapped into $B$ by $X$ via $X^{-1}(B)$ (which must be a set $F \\in \\mathcal F$, by definition of a random variable), and then calculating the probability (via $\\mathbb P$) of this set. Since $\\mathbb P$ is a probability measure with respect to the measurable space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal F)$, this is a possible thing that we can do. We call this particular induced probability measure the *law* of $X$ because, as we will see shortly, it ascribes most of the behaviors about $X$ that we will care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider this from another angle to describe what's going on here. First, we know that $X : \\Omega \\rightarrow S$; that is, $X$ is mapping elements of the event space to the codomain. $X^{-1} : \\Sigma \\rightarrow \\mathcal F$ (the definition of a $(\\mathcal F, \\Sigma)$-random variable) takes us from subsets of the codomain (elements of $\\Sigma$) to measurable subsets of the sample space (elements of $\\mathcal F$). We can then use $\\mathbb P$ to measure these measurable subsets of the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, using compositions, we could describe $\\mathcal L_X \\triangleq \\mathbb P \\circ X^{-1}$. $\\mathcal L_X$ represents the probability that under $X$, a draw from the event space $\\omega$ winds up in $B$. From the definition, it should be pretty clear that $\\mathcal L_X$ is a probability measure on the measurable space $(S, \\Sigma)$:\n",
